        <h3>My Journey With Coding</h3>
        <p>My first experience with any sort of coding was using Scratch, which I started at the age of 7. I  
            loved creating programs that simulated some sort of battle, whether it was Pokemon or Star Wars. While a fair amount of my projects are incomplete, my profile is somehow still up and running (viewable <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Roogie/"> Here</a>.) 
            While my professional endeavors don't involve any Pokemon fights, I believe this was an important step in my journey.
        </p>

            Once I stopped homeschooling, my usage of Scratch died down and I didn't do any sort of coding until my senior year of high school. A friend and I decided to take an introductory (or so we thought) course in C++ at the local community college. Armed with our chromebooks and online compilers, we suffered through the class with almost no understanding
            of how to code at the end. Once I finished that course, I swore off coding for good... or so I thought!

            One of the required classes for everyone at Mines was an introductory Python course.
            Despite being a mechanical engineering major (as well as my promise to myself) I started to enjoy the problem-solving aspect of coding a LOT. There was nothing more exhilerating than passing all autograder tests on the first try,
            and I found myself wanting to learn more about software. I switched majors to Computer Science with a Focus Area in Data Science; admittedly, the focus area pick was arbitrary but I luckily made the right decision!

            Taking an introductory Data Science class in Fall 2024 cemented my decision of major and focus area. I absolutely loved the class, and created several projects as a result. I also realized that I needed to find an internship; after hundreds of applications and a fair amount of luck, I managed to land a Data Science internship at Woodward where I currently work!
            I've been fortunate enough to build models that are in production

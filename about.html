        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            There's nothing I love more than solving problems, whether it be with a clever algorithm or a machine learning model. I aspire to learn as much as I can from every experience I have, and love to build and experiment in my free time. If you'd like to see some of the stuff I've built in my free time, feel free to check out my <a href="projects.html" target="_self">Projects</a>.

        <h3>Discovering Computer Science</h3>
        <p>
            I came to college with a declared major of mechanical engineering, and was certain it was
            the path for me based on some of the engineering classes I had taken in high school. However, I took the required Introduction to Computer Science (taught in Python)
            and something just "clicked". I changed my major, chose a focus area of Data Science (an arbitrary decision at the time... good thing I ended up loving it) and haven't looked back since!

        <p>
            I'm a big fan of being outdoors. While I spend a lot of my time on personal projects, I also have the classic Colorado hobbies of hiking and skiing.
            Going to the gym and disc golfing are also favorites!

            <p>Hello! My name is Jean-Pierre (JP for short) 
                and I'm a senior at the Colorado School of Mines. I'm a data scientist by trade, 
                but have taken an interest in front end web development and decided to make this website.
                If you'd like to learn more about me or some of the projects I've done, feel free to check out some of the links above!

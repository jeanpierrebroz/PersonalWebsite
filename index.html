            <p>Hello! My name is Jean-Pierre (JP for short) 
                and I'm a senior at the Colorado School of Mines.
                If you'd like to learn more about me or 
                some of the projects I've done, feel free to scroll or check out 
                some of the links above!

            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>
                There's nothing I love more than solving problems, whether it be algorithmically or with a machine learning model. 
                I aspire to learn as much as I can from every experience I have, and love to build and experiment in my free time. 
                If you'd like to see some of the things I've worked on, 
                feel free to check out my <a href="projects.html" target="_self">Projects</a>.

            <h3>Professional Endeavors</h3>
            <p>I currently work as a Data Science Intern at Woodward, as well as develop software for HappyPlace Lab (an HCI lab at Mines).
                I've found my niche somewhere between software and machine learning, where I help develop software for and deploy machine learning 
                models into production. I'm also very interested in working in the broad fields of sustainability/greentech.

            <h3>How I Discovered Computer Science</h3>
            <p>
                I came to college with a declared major of mechanical engineering, and was certain it was
                the path for me based on some of the engineering classes I had taken in high school. However, I took the required Introduction to Computer Science (taught in Python)
                and something just "clicked". I changed my major, chose a focus area of Data Science, and haven't looked back since!

            <p>
                I'm a big fan of being outdoors. While I spend a lot of my time on personal projects, I also have the classic Colorado hobbies of hiking and skiing.
                Going to the gym and disc golfing are also favorites!
